To run the "nerve cell" model there are two different scripts:
========================================================================

1)  "cell.ma" which uses offrate = 0.1 ==> use "cell.bat" and then "cell_DRW.bat"

OR 

2)  "cell_06.ma" which uses offrate = 0.6 ==> use "cell_06.bat" and then "cell_06_DRW.bat"

**These two use the same ".pal" file which is called "cellRedBlue.pal"
